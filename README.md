# Google Places APi.

This is a PHP wrapper for **Google Places Api Web Service**. And is [Laravel Framework](https://laravel.com/docs/5.2) friendly.

## About Package
With just 2 lines of code you can request to any google places api feature. No need to manually perform any curl requests.

### The following place requests are available:
* [Place Search](#place-search) return a list of places based on a user's location or search string.
* [Place Details](#place-details) requests return more detailed information about a specific Place, including user reviews.
* [Place Autocomplete](#place-autocomplete) can be used to automatically fill in the name and/or address of a place as you type.
* [Query Autocomplete](#query-autocomplete) can be used to provide a query prediction service for text-based geographic searches, by returning suggested queries as you type.

# Use with Laravel
## Step 1
Set up the service provider and facade in the **config\app.php**
```php

'providers' => [
....
....
SKAgarwal\GoogleApi\ServiceProvider::class,
];

'aliases' => [
....
....
'GooglePlaces' => SKAgarwal\GoogleApi\Facade::class,
];

```

## Step 2
publish the config file with following artisan command
```
php artisan vendor:publish --provider=SKAgarwal\GoogleApi\ServiceProvider
```

This will create **google.php** file in the config directory.

Set the *API KEY* in this config file.

## Set 3
Start using the package using Facade.

```
$response = GooglePlaces::placesAutocomplete('some city');
```
